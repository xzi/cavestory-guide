# Which Version of Cave Story Should I Play?

TLDR: All versions have the same general content in them and are compatiable with this guide **with the except of Cave Story 3D**. You should pick the version that is most conveniant for you.  

With that being said, there are minor differences in between the versions that may impact your decision making. I have gone ahead and listed them all out here alongside the major important differences between them.

## Engine Mods and Ports

There are several unofficial ports of the freeware version of Cave Story to various platforms. If you are interested in those, you can check out the ["Downloads" section on cavestory.org](https://www.cavestory.org/download/cave-story.php) for most of the ports worth playing.  

```admonish warning
The writer of this guide cannot guarrentee that unofficial Cave Story ports will work with this guide. If they were done properly, then they should work fine, but you never know.  
Proceed at your own risk!
```

As for engine mods, there are two worth making a note of.

### Doukutsu-rs

[https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs](https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs)  

Doukutsu-rs is "a fully playable re-implementation of the Cave Story (Doukutsu Monogatari) engine written in Rust." It works with freeware, Cave Story+ on PC, and the switch release. It fixes a bunch of miscilanious bugs, adds some features from the switch port to the PC port, and is very customizable. It is **not** 100% accurate, but in my playtime of Cave Story with Doukutsu-rs, I did not notice any issues that made me think that the mod was unplayable.  

If you do decide to play with Doukutsu-rs, it is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** that you use the [nightly builds](https://nightly.link/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs/workflows/ci/master?preview) instead of the release builds as the release builds have not been updated in a while.

### NXEngine-evo

[https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo](https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo)

NXEngine-evo is an upgrade over the original NXEngine. It is seldom updated and you are better off using Doukutsu-rs. However, if you are playing an unofficial console or mobile port, it is very likely NXEngine-evo or its predecessor was used in the creation process. For that reason alone, I have decided to add it to the list.

Both of the engine mods listed here will work perfectly fine with this guide. They are not required however and simply here to give people an interesting choice for a way to experience Cave Story.

TODO:  

- Figure out how the hell you use periods in bullet points.
- Add more information about NXEngine-evo
