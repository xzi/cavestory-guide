# Which Version of Cave Story Should I Play?

TLDR: All versions have the same general content in them and are compatiable with this guide **with the except of Cave Story 3D**. You should pick the version that is most conveniant for you.  

With that being said, there are minor differences in between the versions that may impact your decision making. I have gone ahead and listed them all out here alongside the major important differences between them.
