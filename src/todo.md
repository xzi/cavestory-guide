# To-do List

This is a public to-do list for the things that need to be done involving the Cave Story guide. If you are interested in contributing to something, feel free to work on it and open a PR.  

- [ ] Acquire screenshots for the guide (I am planning on using doukutsu-rs with screenshots captured at 2560x1440, and downscaling to 1920x1080)
- [ ] Potentially rework the formatting as to not have dupe chapters
